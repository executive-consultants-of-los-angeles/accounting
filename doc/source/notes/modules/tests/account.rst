Account Module Tests
====================

Names should contain only letters.

Numbers should contain only numbers.

Types should be one of the following: [asset, liability, equity, revenue, expense].

.. topic:: Equation

   assets = liabilities + equity

   This makes accounts that can reconcile only those of the first three types.
