Account Notes
=============

What is an account?
-------------------

A collection of related transactions that can be used to describe an aspect of a business.


What the fundamental parts of an account?
-----------------------------------------

Name, number, type, transactions.

.. note:: type

   Type is a reserved word in Python, so we'll use kind instead.


What are the qualities of an account that can be tested?
--------------------------------------------------------

We can test the name for length and composition.

We can test the number for correct placement in the chart of accounts.

We can test the type for its presence in a pre-defined list.

We can test the transactions elsewhere.
